# MQTT-Web Client Examples

This repository contains examples of MQTT-web clients implemented in .NET and JavaScript. These examples demonstrate how to connect to an MQTT broker using the WebSocket protocol, and how to subscribe to MQTT topics.

## Directory Structure

- `dotnet`: This directory contains a .NET-based MQTT-web client example.
- `js`: This directory contains a JavaScript-based MQTT-web client example.

Each directory has its own `readme.md` file that provides instructions on how to configure and run the examples.

## What is MQTT?

MQTT stands for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, and it is a lightweight, open-source messaging protocol designed for use in IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It was created by IBM in 1999 and has since become a widely adopted standard for IoT communication.

MQTT is designed to be efficient, reliable, and easy to implement. It uses a publish/subscribe messaging model, where clients can subscribe to topics and receive messages published on those topics. MQTT supports a variety of messaging patterns, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many communication.

## What is MQTT-Web?

MQTT-Web is an extension to the MQTT protocol that allows it to be used over the WebSocket protocol. This allows MQTT to be used in web applications, where it can be accessed from a web browser. MQTT-Web provides a lightweight and efficient way to communicate between web clients and MQTT brokers, making it an ideal choice for IoT applications that require web-based interfaces.
